BCIT Software Systems Developer - First Project - User Interface Emphasis

We are working as a team on a project idea that we have randomly chosen, but we are passionate about.
As young entrepreneurs who are passionate about food sustainability, we are making a website that
automates the connection between local farmers and customers, who are interested in obtaining produce
or meat from a reputable farm that treats their animals well and caters to sustainable food production.
